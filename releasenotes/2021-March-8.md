This release notes contain new changes for ACS Calling Web (JavaScript) SDK v1.0.0-beta.8 and v1.0.0-beta.9

# Bug fixes
### v1.0.0-beta.8
Media quality improvements - more stabile and uniform quality in all scenarios

### v1.0.0-beta.9
Fixed issue for Safari - DeviceManager.askDevicePermission - when called with both audio:true, video: true, after stream is already acquired for a given device, was loosing track of acquired stream. Since 1.0.0-beta.9, ACS Calling SDK will split these calls into 2 prompts on Safari.

# Breaking API Changes
1. CallState - removed 'Incoming' state, this state is now invalid since 1.0.0-beta.4 introduced IncomingCall


# New features

## Support for multiple CallClient instances
CallClient can now be instantiated multiple times
* each instance can then be used to create new CallAgent instance using `async createCallAgent` API
* you can create only one CallAgent instance from each CallClient instance
* each CallAgent instance must be initialized for a different user, by implementing and passing user specific `CommunicationTokenCredential`

**Example**
```js
const callClientUser1 = new CallClient();
const callAgentUser1 = await callClientUser1.createCallAgent(communicationTokenCredentialForUser1, {displayName: 'User1'});
const callClientUser2 = new CallClient();
const callAgentUser2 = await callClientUser2.createCallAgent(communicationTokenCredentialForUser2, {displayName: 'User2'});
```

## Access DeviceManager without creating CallAgent instance
CallClient API to get DeviceManager instance - `async getDeviceManager()` can now be called prior to initialization of CallAgent instance

**Example**
```js
const callClient = new CallClient();
const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager();
await deviceManager.getCamears();
```
This allows developers to implement UX where user can manage devices or create preview of local camera before user context is known.

## Call transcription 

Call transcription is an extended feature of the core `Call` API. 
In the Teams interop scenarios, when a Teams user starts 'Transcription' on a Teams side,
your application must notify the user that call is being actively transcribed due to privacy reasons.

You first need to obtain the transcription feature API object

**Example**
```js
const callTranscriptionApi = call.api(Features.Transcription);
```

Then, you can check if the audio in the call is being transcribed, inspect the `isTranscriptionActive` property of `callTranscriptionApi`, it returns `Boolean`

**Example**
```js
const isTranscriptionActive = callTranscriptionApi.isTranscriptionActive;
```

You can also subscribe to transcription state changes

**Example**
```js
const isTranscriptionActiveChangedHandler = () => {
  console.log(callTranscriptionApi.isTranscriptionActive);
};
callRecordingApi.on('isTranscriptionActiveChanged', isTranscriptionActiveChangedHandler);
```

To unsubscribe your event handler call

**Example**
```js
callRecordingApi.off('isTranscriptionActiveChanged', isTranscriptionActiveChangedHandler);
```
