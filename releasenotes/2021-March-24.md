This release notes contain new changes for ACS Calling Web (JavaScript) SDK v1.0.0-beta.10

# Breaking API Changes
1. v1.0.0-beta.10 takes dependency on @azure/communication-common@1.0.0-beta.6 and @azure/logger@^1.0.2
2. `CallingApplicationIdentifier` and `CallingApplicationKind`were removed starting from @azure/communication-common@1.0.0-beta.6
Applications that were relying on them can still leverage generic `UnknownIdentifier` and `UnknownIdentifierKind`

    2.1 Call `addParticipant` method doesn't accept `CallingApplicationIdentifier` anymore

    2.2 Call `removeParticipant` method doesn't accept `CallingApplicationIdentifier` anymore

    2.3 CallAgent `startCall`  method doesn't accept `CallingApplicationIdentifier` anymore

    2.4 `CallerInfo` doesn't expose `CallingApplicationIdentifier` anymore as one of the `identifier` types, it will use `UnknownIdentifier` as a fallback

    2.5 `RemoteParticipant` `identifier` property doesn't expose `CallingApplicationIdentifier` anymore, it will use `UnknownIdentifier` as a fallback

3. `isMicrophoneMuted` changed to `isMuted`, if `isMuted` is set to `true` it indicates that local user is muted because of
* application called `mute()` method on the Call object and it resolved
* in Teams interop scenarios - Teams user muted ACS user
* in Teams interop scenarios - Teams user triggered 'mute all' feature for all participants in the meeting

    3.1 `isMutedChanged` event was introduced on the `Call` object

4. `VideoDeviceInfo` - `cameraFacing` property was removed

5. `Renderer` class was renamed to `VideoStreamRenderer`
6. `RendererOptions` type used in `createView` method on `Renderer` is now called `CreateViewOptions`
7. `createView` now returns `VideoStreamRendererView` type instead of `RendererView`



# Other changes

## Logger
CallClient doesn't accept `AzureLogger` instance in options, instead application can control logs by importing `setLogLevel` function and 
calling it with appropriate log level
**Example**
```js
import { setLogLevel } from '@azure/logger';

// configure log level
setLogLevel('verbose');

const callClient = new CallClient();
```

## Errors
Whenever ACS Calling library throws an error, it will contain improved error message, with additional details.

## IncomingCall
`IncomingCall` changes
* added `callEndReason` property of a `CallEndReason` type that indicates why call ended* 

## Prevent race conditions when rendering stream
To prevent race condition where `VideoStreamRendererView` is used to render a `RemoveVideoStream` that becomes unavailable ( `isAvailable` changes to `false` )
`VideoStreamRendererView` will be automatically disposed
* when stream `isAvailable` changes to `false` while `createView()` promise is still pending, `createView()` promise will be rejected
