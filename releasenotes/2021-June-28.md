### Logic Apps Connector

##### Fix
- Bug fix for delivery report not being sent even if delivery report option is set to true in SMS Logic App.
- This **ONLY impacts logic apps created from Mar 30th to April 25th 2021** using the Azure Communication Services SMS connector. These logic apps should have received the update with the bug fix and would not require the logic app to be recreated. The `DeliveryReport` option should be reselected as required.
- `DeliveryReport` option for logic apps created post April 25th 2021, should work as expected.
