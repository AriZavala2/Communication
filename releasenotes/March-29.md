Please note about the [feature set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features) and [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/known-issues)

Moving forward, we will be having two versions of the SDKs:

* v x.x.x-Beta.x - the SDK versions provide access to new functionality, which is not at the General Availability milestone. E.g., Teams Interoperability is supported in the Beta versions.
